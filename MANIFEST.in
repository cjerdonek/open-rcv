# This file specifies what non-default files to include in a

# We use the Python package `check-manifest` to validate that this file
# is correct.  See the project documentation for details.

# The following files get included automatically, so there is no need
# to include them explicitly (there may be ):

#   MANIFEST.in
#   setup.py
